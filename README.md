# 🌐 Personal Bio Website (FED Week 1)

This project is part of **Front-End Development - Week 1** tasks.  
It covers the basics of semantic HTML, CSS styling, Flexbox layout, and JavaScript interactivity.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **modern, responsive personal bio website** that introduces yourself, demonstrates semantic HTML structure, applies CSS for styling, and uses JavaScript for interactivity.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

### ✅ Task 1: Personal Bio Page
- Semantic HTML structure (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  
- Header with **name/title**.  
- Profile picture.  
- Short biography paragraph.  
- A styled list of hobbies.  
- A clickable **social media/LinkedIn link**.  

### ✅ Task 2: Simple Navigation Bar
- A **fixed navigation bar** at the top of the page.  
- Built with **CSS Flexbox** for horizontal layout.  
- Contains 4–5 links (Home, About, Hobbies, Projects, Contact).  
- Hover effects on links (color/background changes).  

### ✅ Task 3: Color Theme Switcher
- Two buttons: **Light Theme** and **Dark Theme**.  
- JavaScript logic implemented in **two ways**:  
  1. By directly manipulating element `.style`.  
  2. By toggling CSS classes on the `<body>` element.  
- Smooth transition effects when switching themes.
